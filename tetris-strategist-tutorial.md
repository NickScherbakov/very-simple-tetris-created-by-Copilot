# Tetris Strategist Roadmap

## Why Strategy Matters

A strong Tetris player does more than clear lines. Strategy lets you convert every piece into progress, survive faster speeds, and win versus people or adaptive AIs. This roadmap guides you from first launch to tournament-style decision making so you can build confidence step by step.

## Stage 1 – Learn the Foundations

### 1. Understand the Scoring
- **Singles/Doubles/Triples/Tetrises**: focus early on stacking for Tetrises (four-line clears) because they are the most efficient point source.
- **Soft vs. Hard Drop**: soft drops cost time; practice using hard drops to lock pieces immediately while staying accurate.
- **Combo and Back-to-Back Bonuses**: many modern rule-sets reward consecutive line clears and Tetrises; read your game ruleset.

### 2. Master Basic Inputs
- Keep your fingers on **Left**, **Right**, **Rotate**, and **Drop** at all times.
- Learn the delayed auto shift (DAS) behaviour in your version: how long you must hold a key before it repeats.
- Practice sliding pieces under overhangs by holding a direction before locking them.

### 3. Learn the Primary Piece Shapes
- Memorise the spawn orientation of I, J, L, O, S, T, Z pieces.
- Practice finding a natural home for each piece in an empty field—this creates “default placements" you can lean on under pressure.

## Stage 2 – Build Clean Stacks

### 4. Flat Stacking Principles
- Keep stacks flat with a consistent skyline; sudden high columns reduce placement options.
- Always leave a single open column for the I-piece when aiming for Tetrises.

### 5. Maintain Low Garbage Risk
- Avoid creating **holes** (covered empty cells). If you must create one, plan an immediate fix.
- Use Z- and S-pieces to even out awkward surfaces instead of forcing them into already flat areas.

### 6. Learn the Hold Queue (if available)
- Hold the I-piece when it arrives early so you can trigger a Tetris when the setup is ready.
- Practice cycling between active, next, and hold pieces with minimal pause.

## Stage 3 – Advanced Clears and Survival

### 7. T-Spin Fundamentals
- Recognise T-shaped cavities that allow a T-piece to rotate into place for a two- or three-line clear plus a bonus.
- Try building simple T-spin doubles: create a 3-wide cavity with a roof, leave one block missing, and drop the T-piece with a rotation kick.

### 8. Combo Stacks
- Build 2-wide or 3-wide wells that allow continual line clears with each placement.
- Start combos only when you have a clear plan; stalled combos collapse your stack quickly.

### 9. Crisis Recovery
- When the board is high, prioritise clearing any line rather than chasing Tetrises.
- Fill obvious gaps first and use vertical I-pieces to carve channels back to the bottom.

## Stage 4 – Reading the Game State

### 10. Preview Management
- Train yourself to read at least the next two pieces before placing the current one.
- Use the preview to set up future moves even if the current placement is obvious.

### 11. Garbage Awareness (Versus Modes)
- Track incoming garbage indicators; clean your stack before the garbage lands if possible.
- Send garbage back by maintaining back-to-back Tetrises or T-spins.

### 12. Adaptive AI and Human Opponents
- Watch how adaptive opponents exploit holes and tall columns. Fix the weaknesses they target first.
- Mix your attack patterns (Tetrises, T-spins, combos) to stay unpredictable.

## Stage 5 – Training Routines

### 13. Solo Drills
- **Rotation Drill**: spawn only one piece type and practise every placement possibility.
- **Speed Ladder**: play at increasing sensitivities or gravity levels until you reach controlled inconsistency, then hold that speed until it feels calm.
- **Perfect Clear Practice**: learn standard openers that lead to early perfect clears for momentum.

### 14. Review and Analysis
- Record games or use replay files; examine where the stack became unstable.
- Identify recurring bad habits (e.g., stacking over the well, relying on hold too often).
- Track improvement metrics: average lines survived, T-spin count, garbage sent/received ratios.

### 15. Mental Conditioning
- Build patience: pause if you misdrop instead of compounding mistakes.
- Develop an internal rhythm; breathing and consistent key timing reduce panic at high speed.
- Treat losses as data—what pattern did the opponent or AI exploit repeatedly?

---

## Stage 6 – Becoming a Strategist

### 16. Opening Repertoires
- Learn named openers (Perfect Clear, DT Cannon, Imperial Cross) that guarantee early pressure.
- Practise switching openers mid-game when piece sequences do not cooperate.

### 17. Mid-Game Flexibility
- Alternate between clean Tetris play and aggressive T-Spin/Combo play based on opponent pressure.
- Identify when to abandon a plan early: if you spend three pieces trying to force a setup, reset the field instead.

### 18. Endgame Pressure
- When both players are topping out, it's often better to send quick single-line garbage to finish the match.
- Use the hold queue to store an I- or T-piece for the final strike.

## Tools and Resources
- **Training Clients**: Jstris, TETR.IO, QuadraBots (for AI sparring on this project).
- **Community Guides**: Tetris Wiki for rotation systems, Hard Drop forums for strategy.
- **Analytics**: trackers that log APS (attacks per second) and APM (actions per minute) help quantify progress.

## Putting It All Together

1. **Week 1**: focus on basic stacking, hard drops, and reading the next queue.
2. **Week 2**: add Tetris focus with hold management and simple T-spins.
3. **Week 3**: integrate combos and garbage awareness; start studying replays.
4. **Week 4**: drill advanced openers, practise against adaptive AI, and refine your mental game.

Becoming a Tetris strategist is a continuous process. Keep iterating on your stack habits, study opponents (human or AI), and log your insights after each session. With deliberate practice, you will recognise patterns faster, recover from mistakes sooner, and eventually control the pace of every match.
